Welcome to the Leo programming language. Leo is a functional, statically-typed programming language built
for writing private applications. Leo is a high-level programming language that compiles down to low-level Aleo Instructions.

:::info
The Leo language is currently in active development. Please monitor the repository on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo) for possibly breaking changes.
