**Aleo Testnet I** is an experimental network for developers to begin building and testing applications on Aleo.
Testnet I is used by the core team for designing and evaluating new circuits, planning and staging network upgrades,
and running experimental features for inclusion on mainnet.

This testnet is **not** ready for production use and will undergo thorough audit and testing before reaching production.
