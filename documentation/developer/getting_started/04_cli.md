In the [**hello world**](02_hello_world.md) guide we executed `leo run`.
This command runs several other Leo CLI commands before verifying a proof.
```bash
leo run
```

## Step by step

Let's walk through each command called by `leo run` and get a better understanding of what's happening under the hood. 
First, remove all build files with:
```bash
leo clean
```

### 1. Build

The `leo build` command compiles the program file `main.leo`. Leo will check program syntax and produce the circuit. 
```bash
leo build
```
To avoid unnecessary future compilations, Leo creates a checksum at **outputs/hello-world.sum**. 
The **outputs** directory will store all files generated by the Leo CLI.

```bash title="console output:"
  leo  Compiled program file "/{$PATH}/hello-world/src/main.leo"
```


### 2. Setup

The `leo setup` command generates a proving key at **outputs/hello-world.lpk** and a verifying key at **outputs/hello-world.lvk**.
```bash
leo setup
```
```leo title="console output:"
  leo  Compiled program file "/{$PATH}/hello-world/src/main.leo"
  leo  Setup starting...
  leo  Program circuit successfully synthesized!
  leo  Writing to output registers...
  leo  Setup completed in 871 milliseconds
  leo  Saving proving key ("/{$PATH}/hello-world/hello-world.lpk")
  leo  Saving verification key ("/{$PATH}/hello-world/hello-world.lvk")
  leo  Program setup complete
```

### 3. Prove

The `leo prove` command generates a proof at **outputs/hello-world.proof** using the inputs at **inputs/hello-world.in** and proving key at **outputs/hello-world.lpk**`. 
```bash
leo prove
```

```bash title="console output:"
  leo  Compiled program file "/{$PATH}/hello-world/src/main.leo"
  leo  Loading saved setup...
  leo  Program setup complete
  leo  Proving...
  leo  Program circuit successfully synthesized!
  leo  Writing to output registers...
  leo  Prover completed in 179 milliseconds
  leo  Proof stored ("/{$PATH}/hello-world/outputs/hello-world.proof")
  leo  Completed program proving
```

### 4. Verify

The `leo run` command verifies the proof at **outputs/hello-world.proof** using the verifying key **outputs/hello-world.lvk** 
and outputs the verifier result to console.
```bash
leo run
```

```bash title="console output:"
  leo  Compiled program file "/{$PATH}/hello-world/src/main.leo"
  leo  Loading saved setup...
  leo  Program setup complete
  leo  Proving...
  leo  Program circuit successfully synthesized!
  leo  Writing to output registers...
  leo  Prover completed in 11 milliseconds
  leo  Proof stored ("/{$PATH}/hello-world/outputs/hello-world.proof")
  leo  Completed program proving

  Verifier time   : 3 milliseconds
  Verifier output : true
```

The `leo run` command will attempt to verify a proof only if all previous steps completed successfully.
Under the hood, the Leo [CLI](../cli/07_run.md) will check for existing `.sum`, `.lpk`, `.lvk`, or `.proof` files 
in the **outputs** directory before running each command. This ensures that we don't run unnecessary commands.

### 5. Program Outputs

The return value of the `main` function is stored in the program's output file `outputs/hello-world.out`

```leo title="outputs/hello-world.out"
[registers]
r0: u32 = 3u32;
```
Try editing the inputs in `input/hello-world.in` and then executing `leo run`. If you provided different input values to the program,
then you should see different results written to the output registers. Be sure to run `leo clean` to delete the old checksum.
