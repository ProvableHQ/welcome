sidebar_label: Overview

Welcome to the Leo programming language. Leo is a functional, statically-typed programming language built
for writing private applications.

:::info
The Leo language is currently in active development. Please monitor the repository on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo) for breaking changes
:::

## Installing Leo

Proceed to [**Installation**](01_installation.md) for information on how to install Leo.

## Getting Started

Check out the [**Hello World**](02_hello_world.md) tutorial for a brief walk-through of Leo and the Leo CLI.

## Language Documentation

To learn the core concepts and syntax of Leo, start with the [**Layout of a Leo Program**](../language/01_layout.md).
Leo comes with an advanced testing framework for writing unit and integration tests. Read [**Writing Tests**](../language/12_tests.md) to learn more.

## Programming Model

Leo programs are designed to work with Aleo [**record**](../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md) and [**transaction**](../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md) data. 
Understanding how to access and compute on this data is essential to writing private applications. 
Read the [**Model**](../programming_model/00_model.md) to learn more.

## Command Line Interface Documentation

The Leo CLI provides a suite of commands to make programming in Leo easy.

Develop your program with [**new**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/01_new.md), [**build**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/03_build.md), [**watch**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/04_watch.md), 
[**test**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/05_test.md), and [**clean**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/14_clean.md).

Download packages from the Aleo Package Manager with [**add**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/10_add.md), [**remove**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/11_remove.md), [**login**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/09_login.md), and [**publish**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/12_publish.md).

Once your Leo program is compiled, generate proofs with [**setup**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/06_setup.md), [**prove**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/07_prove.md), and [**run**](aleo/documentation/developer/cli/08_run.md).

## Additional Material

Is your Leo code formatted correctly? Check out the [**Style Guide**](../additional_material/00_style.md) and [**Common Patterns**](../additional_material/01_common.md) for the official guidelines.

Found a bug? Have an idea for a feature? Proceed to the [**Known Bugs**](../additional_material/02_bugs.md) section and the [**Contributing Guide**](../additional_material/03_contributing.md).
