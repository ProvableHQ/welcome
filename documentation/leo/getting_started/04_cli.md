In the [**hello world**](02_hello_world.md) guide we executed `leo run`.
This command runs several other Leo CLI commands before verifying a proof.
```bash
leo run
```

## Step by step

Let's walk through each command called by `leo run` and get a better understanding of what's happening under the hood. 
First, remove all build files with:
```bash
leo clean
```

```bash title="console output:"
  Cleaning ✅ Cleaned the build directory (in "/build/")
```

### 1. Build

The `leo build` command compiles the program file `main.leo`. Leo will check program syntax and produce the `main.aleo` file. 
```bash
leo build
```
The **build** directory will store all files generated by the Leo CLI.

```bash title="console output:"
     Build ✅ Compiled 'main.leo' into Aleo instructions (in "/hello/build/main.aleo")
     Build ✅ Built 'hello.aleo' (in "/hello/build")
```


### 2. Run

The `leo run` command executes the `/build/main.aleo` Aleo program using the Aleo SDK.
For more information read the Aleo SDK [documentation](../../aleo/overview)
```bash
leo run
```

```bash title="console output:"
 Build ✅ Compiled 'main.leo' into Aleo instructions (in "/hello/build/main.aleo")
⏳ Compiling 'hello.aleo'...

 • Loaded universal setup (in 100 ms)
 • Built 'main' (in 1000 ms)

     Build ✅ Built 'hello.aleo' (in "/hello/build")
 • Loaded universal setup (in 100 ms)
🚀 Executing 'hello.aleo/main'...

 • Executing 'hello.aleo/main'...
 • Executed 'main' (in 1000 ms)

➡️  Output

 • 3u32

 Executing ✅ Executed 'hello.aleo/main' (in "/hello/build")
```

The `leo run` command will attempt to verify a proof only if all previous steps completed successfully.
Under the hood, the Leo [CLI](../cli/08_run.md) will check for existing `.sum`, `.lpk`, `.lvk`, or `.proof` files 
in the **outputs** directory before running each command. This ensures that we don't run unnecessary commands.
