title: The Leo Programming Language
sidebar_label: Overview
---

Welcome to the Leo programming language. Leo is a functional, statically-typed programming language built
for writing private applications. Leo is a high-level programming language that compiles down to low-level Aleo Instructions.

:::info
The Leo language is currently in active development. Please monitor the repository on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo) for breaking changes
:::

## Installing Leo

Proceed to [**Installation**](01_installation.md) for information on how to install Leo.

## Getting Started

Check out the [**Hello World**](02_hello_world.md) tutorial for a brief walk-through of Leo and the Leo CLI.

## Formal Language Documentation

A formal ABNF grammar specification for Leo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/tree/testnet3/docs/grammar).

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (To learn the core concepts and syntax of Leo, start with the [**Layout of a Leo Program**]&#40;../language/01_layout.md&#41;.)

[//]: # (Leo comes with an advanced testing framework for writing unit and integration tests. Read [**Writing Tests**]&#40;../language/12_tests.md&#41; to learn more.)

[//]: # (## Programming Model)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Leo programs are designed to work with Aleo [**record**]&#40;../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md&#41; and [**transaction**]&#40;../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md&#41; data. )

[//]: # (Understanding how to access and compute on this data is essential to writing private applications. )

[//]: # (Read the [**Model**]&#40;../programming_model/00_model.md&#41; to learn more.)

## Command Line Interface Documentation

The Leo CLI provides a suite of commands to make programming in Leo easy.

- [**leo new**](../cli/01_new.md)
- [**leo build**](../cli/02_build.md)
- [**leo run**](../cli/03_run.md)
- [**leo clean**](../cli/04_clean.md).
- [**leo test**](../cli/05_test.md)
